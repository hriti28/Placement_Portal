							<p><b>Best Company to Start your career with. ~ Fresher</b><br>
						Job Satisfaction: 4/5 As a fresher, I see contentment all around me. Is there any doubt at all that TCS or even TATA group for that matter, goes out of the way to ensure the well being of its employees<br>
						Salary: 4/5 Although salary is according to Industrial standards, increment is needed, even for Assistant System Engineer(trainee) post.<br>
						Career Growth: 5/5 Why hasn't anyone spoken of'Tata Administrative Services(TAS)'. After 2 years of work exp, employees have the chance of submitting their GMAT score and sitting through a series of Interviews to get into top Management positions of TATA affiliated companies. Why has this point conveniently been omitted by other employees/interns?<br>
						Leisure time: 5/5 Chilled Work Environment. Although we must avoid being benched.<br>
						Interaction with peers and seniors: 5/5 Excellent Help, support and guidance from all sides.<br>
						Verticals and Horizontals in the Organization: 4/5 BPI, Mainframe and IoT shall revolutionize the Industry as we speak.<br>
						On site Opportunities: 4/5 There are a reasonable no. of Onsite opportunities. A lot depends on luck and the department you are allocated in.<br>
						Overall rating rounded off to 5. Excellent Company. Hats off to CEO Natarajan Chandrasekaran.<br>

						<h3><u><b>Alumni Reviews</b></u></h3>
						<p><b>Cisco is an amzaing place to work.</b><br>
						Amazing people, amazing culture, amazing benefits. But all these things are not matched with job security. Every August they fire bunch of people in the name of limited restructuring and it is not based on performance , it is random. Lot of reorganization happening every 4-5 months so growth is very slow, yearly increment is 4-5% only..<br>
